# BouncingBox

This is currently only in 1 c file but it might be expanded in the future if i decide to make it more serious
for screens smaller than 1440p you must change the screen dimentions, size is the size of the app and res is the resolution at which the animation is being rendered
having the resolution be larger than the size will likely cause errors but i havent tested it
having the resolution be really small will make the cube (SDL_Rect object named ball) appear larger if it is not adjusted
